# Memory

### Summary
Memory (or Concentration) is a solitaire game that challenges a single player to find all matching pairs of cards in a shuffled deck of cards in as few moves as possible.
While this closely follows the structure of Udacity's Memory game project, the game has been rewritten and restyled from the ground up.

### Demo:
You can play the game at https://partiallymisplaced.github.io/memory-game/

### How to play:
The game starts with all cards facing down.

The player clicks to open cards in pairs of two. If the cards match, they remain open; if they don't, they get flipped back facing down. Every match attempt is counted as 1. The star rating decreases as the number of match attempts increases.

The game ends when all matching pairs have been revealed.
